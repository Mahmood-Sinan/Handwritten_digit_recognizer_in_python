# Handwritten_digit_recognizer_in_python
Hi
This is Neural network model in python to recognize handwritten digits
For this model, I followed this tutorial: https://youtu.be/bte8Er0QhDg?si=tiVMQ6_jzP_1ZBMb

To run the model: 
modify the digits in the digits folder with new png files 

run tested_model.py

Here the weights and bias are already imported from the mnist dataset. The model is trained to an epoch of 3. You can change it if you want more accuracy.

Thank You!
